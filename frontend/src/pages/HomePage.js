       <p>
           I got into coding mainly because I thought it would be easy since
            it was tied to math in a way, but as I took more classes I grew more
            interested in the field. Instead of thinking that it would be easy for me,
            I thought that it would be fun. My career goal is to someday work in the
            tech industry, preferably a software engineer. I really enjoy working
            with computers and code, and I like the struggle and challenges that
            come with it. Below are all the major technologies that were used in this website.

            <ol>
                <li>HTML is a markup language used for creating and structuring the content on a website. It provides the basic structure of the website, which can be improved by other languages like CSS and JavaScript.</li>
                <li>CSS is a style sheet language used for modifying the document written in HTML. CSS allows for the creation of visually engaging web pages and responsive design.</li>
                <li>JavaScript is a programming language that enables dynamic interactions and functionalities on the web. It is used to create better user interfaces and handle events like clicks and form submissions.</li>
                <li>React is used for building more responsive user interfaces. It allows developers to create large web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes.</li>
                <li>Node.js allows developers to use JavaScript to write server side code, enabling the development of scalable and high performance web applications.</li>
                <li>Express is a Node.js web application framework that provides a set of features to develop web and mobile applications. It simplifies the process of setting up a web server and handling routing.</li>
                <li>RESTful APIs were used to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on data.</li>
                <li>Favicon is a small icon associated with a website, displayed in the browser's address bar or tab. It enhances the site's branding and provides a visual identifier for the website.</li>
                <li>Image optimization was used to reduce the file size of images without sacrificing quality, which makes faster load times and better performance. This includes using formats like JPEG, PNG, SVG, and WebP, as well as implementing compression techniques
                    such as Lossless and Lossy.</li>
                <li>Asynchronous programming allows a program to start a long-running task and continue executing other tasks without waiting for the long-running task to finish. This is achieved using async/await, and callback functions in JavaScript.</li>
                <li>Document Object Model is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects, which allows developers to modify content and structure with JavaScript.</li>
                <li>MongoDB is a database that stores data in flexible JSON style documents. It is used for handling large volumes of unstructured data.</li>
            </ol>
